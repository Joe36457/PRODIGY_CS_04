The Keylogger is a simple software that can record all of the keystrokes make by the user on his or her computer or mobile device. A normal user who is not much into computers does not keep an eye on the processes running on their computer. Lending your computer for use can also be an easy way to get tracked by a keylogger. 
A simple example: At your workplace someone randomly asks your computer for browsing purposes. They can Run a keylogger on your machine when you are not monitoring what they do and in the simple code attached below the keylogger basically records all of the keystrokes and saves it to a key_log.txt file. This file which saves all the recorded information can hold any name and it can be saved anywhere on your PC. And if the person can get access to your computer once again, all the keystrokes recorded can be used by this person to use it against You. This simple code basically records all of the keystrokes which includes all the keys on the keyboard and that is the weakness. No password or userID holds something which is outside the characters, symbols or numbers used outside what is there on the keyboard and the keylogger takes advantage of it.
